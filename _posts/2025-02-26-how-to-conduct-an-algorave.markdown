You don't need anyone's permission to do a gig.

## Music Marketting 101

### Bare minimum

1. Poster
2. Trailer
3. Way to get ticket money
4. Pay any venue for cold hard cash and they will give you a timeslot.
5. Get friends friends, performers or do some marketing

Push vs Pull

Push is basically spam.

Pull basically attracts because of novelty.

Basic sales conversion metric for online 10,000 views is 100 likes is 1 customer.

Online marketting is mostly a scam for investors because of fake bots and fake accounts.
Try more novel ways.

Tag artists and nodes and algorave on socials.

## Fund raising techniques

0. Pre-Booking
1. Ticket sales
2. T shirts
3. Asking family for funds
4. Crowd funding
5. Govt funds
6. Sell CDs / pen drives
7. Advertisements
8. Influencer marketting
9. Venue promotion
10. Revenue share with venue
11. Self
12. Teaching / Consultancy services
13. Sponsorers
14. Existing communities that are similiarly aligned


Create a pitch deck for venues, fund raising and promoters to make it easy for them to know who you are, who the artists are.

For consultancy you can charge from - 5$ to 5000$

## Equipment

1. Speakers
2. Projector / TV
3. Cables
4. Zoom for remote conferences
5. Power Backup
6. Wifi

Or you can always rent it.

Camera rig for recording.

Average videographer charge - 100$ - 500$.

Live stream just needs a very simple setup.
Connect the camera to the zoom call.

Pay google drive for storage.

Do a sound check for 2 hours atleast.

## But how to get a venue

Most venues are open for simple cash deals, where they simply give you a timeslot.

Cheap venues - cafe's and hotels. Tourist spots.

Play on the street.

VRChat.

## Artists

Plan for artists who don't stick to their word. Plan for backup artists just in case.

Good artists charge money. Pay them. It's good to mix up Live Coding with other genres.

Average price for atists - 30$ to 1000$.

Recommended artist shift time gap - 20 minutes. For professionals 5 minutes.

# Open Revenue and Open Company

Open Company is a new form of business where sharing revenue details makes the company transparent,
thereby making most problems of "evil capitalism" go away.

For this purposes I would however like to coin Open Revenue.

Everyone is paid according to their worth and how much they they put in.

This also avoids backroom deals which plagues the music industry, like recording labels ...
which while making the artist popular might demand censorship or removal of band members. So all agreements also should be made open.

Open source merely opens up the source. Open source is still plagued by exploitative practises. GPL is a waste of time.
Charity fraud plagues most non-profits.

Because music + code walks a thin line between Art and Code, I would recommend Creative Commons Licenses or plain old copyright.

Trademark or Company registation is optional but it helps, if you are serious about things.

The name of the game is - book a venue, fill people in, take the money home .. give people a fair
share.

Avoid verbal contracts.
Get everything in writing.
