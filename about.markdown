          TOPLAP is an organisation founded in 2004, to explore and promote live coding.<br><br>
          This is the node of TOPLAP for Hyderabad / Bhagyanagar.<br><br>

          An algorave (from an algorithm and rave) is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using live coding techniques.<br><br>

          Live coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is getting somewhere interesting. Live coders expose and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music and/or visuals. All code manipulation is projected for your pleasure. Live coding works across musical genres, and has been seen in concert halls, late night jazz bars, as well as algoraves. There is also a strong movement of video-based live coders, writing code to make visuals, and many environments can do both sound and video, creating synaesthetic experiences.<br><br>

          Almost all live coding environments can be downloaded, used and even modified and shared for free, with documentation and examples to get you started and friendly on-line communities to help when you get problems. Popular live coding software includes ChucK,  Cyril, extempore, fluxus, impromptu, overtone and supercollider. Environments designed for fast exploration of musical pattern include ixi lang and TidalCycles. Sonic Pi is designed for teaching both music and computer science in classrooms. There are also impressively capable web-based live coding environments like gibber, strudel and livecodelab. Live patching is live coding with graph-based languages such as the venerable pure-data.<br><br>
